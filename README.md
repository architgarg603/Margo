# Margo - Menstrual Health and Hygiene

As a part of 'Self-Care', Menstrual Health is as crucial as taking care of your day-to-day activities. Margo is a web app created to provide females a personalized companion to follow their period cycle, fertility, or pregnancy. With an accurate period and ovulation predictor, mood swings monitor, and pamper booth, Margo can act as a true health companion.  

<b> Motivation: </b> The onset of menstruation coincides with new opportunities and vulnerabilities. Poor menstrual hygiene is one of the major reasons for the high prevalence of Reproductive Tract Infections and contributes significantly to female morbidity. But a proper track record of the menstrual cycle can help reduce many such problems.

<b> Solved Problems: </b> Period Tracking can help avoid an unplanned pregnancy or even help determine the right time for a baby. For women who are trying to avoid pregnancy, it can be used as natural birth control. The menstrual cycle is a direct indicator of overall health, and periods are the body's way of telling that things are working as they should. 

<b> Learnings: </b> Through project Margo, we learned about the various aspects of Menstrual Health and Hygiene and the process of making static web pages to building and deploying full-stack web applications.

# Challenges Faced

"If you are not facing challenges while developing an application, you are not considering every possible case for a better experience of your users."

During the development process we faced the following challenges: 
1. In the given time constraint, the development of the complete product posed a major challenge for us. But it allowed us to understand the essence of Time Management and Organised Working. 
2. The deployment of APIs for the articles on Heroku presented a lot of issues. However, thanks to online communities, StackOverflow, we were able to find resources that helped us in successfully deploying the APIs.
3.  Integration of API to the web page was also a challenge for us but eventually, we were able to conquer the challenge.

All these challenges were less of challenges and more of lessons, lessons to help us have an even better development process in the future so that we can incorporate the customers' requests and requirements easily and efficiently.
